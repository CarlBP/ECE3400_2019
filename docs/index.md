# ECE 3400 Intelligent Physical Systems

## Cornell University, Fall 2019

Welcome to ECE 3400!

You will learn to tie the fundamental principles of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) across virtual and physical boundaries to create autonomous robots able to perceive, reason about, and act upon their environment. 

In teams of 4-6 students,  you will design and fabricate a robot able to navigate and map out a maze with treasures in the shortest possible time.

Under peer-to-peer mentoring, the students upload their progress and ideas to create a sustainable and continuously evolving database for future students to rely on. See past years:
